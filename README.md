A basic Instant Messaging server (MSN Messenger replica) made with Node.js, for the sake of learning more about Javascript & Typescript, Node.js, Websockets.

# Features:

* Receiving/sending messages in the form of customized Websocket messages (well, of course, since that this is a chat app)

* Saving users & user rooms (say, if the person X initiates a conversation with the person Y, there is initialized a room for them to talk), messages onto an MSSQL database

* Reading login/registration/last sent message requests via an HTTP server
